Therefore a poll to see who is available and which date suits everyone best. The call will probably start at 19:00 GMT+2 but this can be changed when the chosen date arises. The dates we can choose from for October: \n\n
            ðŸ”µ = October 1st (01-10-2020). \n
            ðŸŸ  = October 9'th (09-10-2020). \n

            Please **react with the color** of your date of choice. Feel free to choose multiple events, a single one or none at all.\n\n
            Also because of the super high number of votes on 'Movie Night' in the poll in the #events channel we will go ahead and schedule this too.` }
